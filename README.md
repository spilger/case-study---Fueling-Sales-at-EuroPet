# case-study---Fueling-Sales-at-EuroPet
Mannheim Business School assignment task

During the course, participants will analyze and solve the quantitative case study “Fueling Sales at EuroPet”. For the case study, participants will work in groups. Each group (team) is required to prepare a short model(s), analyses and recommendation outline.

 

In this outline you should answer the following questions:

## 1. To obtain an initial overview of the data, calculate the minimum, average, and maximum value of the variables Sales, Fuel Volume, TV, and Radio.


## 2. Run a regression of c-store sales against TV and radio GRPs.

A. Do the two advertising variables have a statistically significant effect on c-store sales?

B. Emily Tyler demands proof of the profitability of c-store advertising. Based on your regression, does advertising appear to sufficiently boost c-store sales to justify the advertising spend? Provide an estimate for the net impact of c-store advertising.
## 3. When Blanchard shows your previous regression to Tyler to make his case for c-store advertising, she flat-out rejects your analysis. She argues that you omitted an important variable, namely the average high temperature in a week. ‘’As we all know,’’ she says, ’’we advertise more during the warm weather periods in Marseille. So the seemingly large effect of advertising in your regression is not truly due to the positive impact of advertising but instead reflects the impact good weather has on driving and on the demand for gas and convenience items.’’

A. To address Tyler’s criticism, include temperature in your previous regression.

B. Compare your new regression (with three independent variables) to your previous regression. Does Tyler’s criticism appear to be justified? Explain.

C. Drop all variables from your regression that do not meet Tyler’s desired level of significance. Based on the resulting regression, does advertising appear to be profitable? Provide an estimate for the net impact of c-store advertising.

## 4. When you show your latest regression to Blanchard, he becomes rather concerned that you have not accounted for many other factors that could affect c-store sales. Surely Tyler will sooner or later complain about that fact. He asks you to extend your analysis. To address Blanchard’s concerns, include all other variables (excluding the week of the year).

A. Drop again all variables from your regression that do not meet Tyler’s desired level of significance. Report your final regression equation.

B. Carefully interpret the meaning of each slope coefficient in the context of this case. Comment on the signs of the coefficients. Do you observe any seemingly unintuitive signs? Provide possible explanations for any such signs.
 

Your model, analysis and recommendation outline should not exceed 25 (!) slides. On the slides the team should summarize the answer of the case questions above. We will select two groups randomly to present their model(s), analysis results and recommendations. All teams have to upload their slides (presentations) on Canvas until 10:30am (CET) on Friday, January 26, 2024.
